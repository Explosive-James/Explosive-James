# Explosive James

Unity / C# hobbyist game developer and occational Blender 3d modeller / animator.  

### Current Interest / Activities:

* Trying to convert many of the specialised systems I find myself remaking for every project, making them more modular and converting them into Unity packages for easy of access and use.  
* Working on a personal 3d platformer game, planet hopping in a strange and wacky sci-fi galaxy.  
* Recently programmed generalised Radix LSD sorting because it was too beautiful and genius not to.
